# ECE 337 Organization Github

Hosts the Lab Manuals, Course Development Notes, and Back-end code for ECE 337: ASIC Design Laboratory

## Manuals

Repository with the .tex, .pdf, and changelog for the ECE 337 Lab Manuals. These are the canon versions to pull from and updates should go here before distribution.

## Coursedev

Repository with the WIP-versions of Labs, Lab Manuals, and Homework assignments for the course. Todo list included. Maybe lesson plans? 
This is where improvements to learning, student understanding, and course content can take place.

## Backend

Repository with the Fusesoc and other components for running the submission and grading systems. Includes documentation for future Staff/GTA/UTA reference on how it works.
